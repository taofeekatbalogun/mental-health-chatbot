FAQ,Answer
"I can't stop overthinking. How do I break the cycle?","Overthinking often stems from anxiety. Try the '5-4-3-2-1' grounding technique: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. This interrupts the thought loop."
"Why do I feel tired all the time even after sleeping?","Chronic fatigue can link to depression, stress, or sleep disorders. Track your sleep patterns and consider a medical checkup. Small lifestyle changes (hydration, short walks) may help too."
"How do I set boundaries without feeling guilty?","Boundaries protect your energy. Start with: 'I need [X] to be my best self.' Remember: You're not responsible for others' reactions to your limits."
"I had a bad therapy session. Should I quit?","Not all therapists are the right fit. It's okay to try 2-3 sessions or request a different provider. Therapy is like shoes—one size doesn’t fit all."
"Can exercise really help my mental health?","Yes! Even 10-minute walks release mood-boosting endorphins. Yoga or dancing count too. Start tiny—stand up and stretch right now if you can."
"What’s the difference between ADHD and anxiety?","ADHD involves focus/impulse challenges; anxiety is excessive worry. They can overlap. A specialist can evaluate you—many adults go undiagnosed."
"I feel lonely in a crowd. Is this normal?","Absolutely. Loneliness is about connection quality, not people quantity. Try joining small groups (book clubs, support groups) with shared interests."
"How do I know if I need medication?","Medication can help when symptoms disrupt daily life (eating, working, relationships). A psychiatrist can discuss options—it’s okay to explore this."
"Why do I self-sabotage when things go well?","Fear of success or unworthiness beliefs might lurk beneath. Journal: 'What am I afraid will happen if I succeed?' Therapy can unpack this."
"Are mental health apps effective?","Some are! Try CBT-based apps like Woebot or Sanvello. They’re tools, not replacements for human care. Research before downloading."
"How can I calm down during a meltdown?","Try TIPP skills: Temperature (splash cold water), Intense exercise (jumping jacks), Paced breathing (4-7-8 method), Paired muscle relaxation."
"What if my family doesn’t believe in mental health?","Their disbelief doesn’t invalidate your experience. Seek support elsewhere (friends, online communities). You’re prioritizing your health—that’s brave."
"Is crying a sign of weakness?","No! Crying releases stress hormones. It’s a biological reset button. Society mislabels vulnerability—it’s actually strength."
"How do I rebuild trust after a mental health crisis?","Start small: Consistent actions over time rebuild trust. Communicate openly: 'I’m working on [X]. I appreciate your patience.'"
"Can diet affect my mood?","Yes. Gut health impacts serotonin production. Try omega-3s (fish), probiotics (yogurt), and reducing processed sugar. Hydrate!"
"Why do holidays trigger my depression?","Holidays highlight 'shoulds' (family, joy) vs reality. Scale back obligations. Create new traditions that honor YOUR needs."
"How do I explain burnout to my boss?","Frame it as capacity: 'I’m optimizing my productivity by addressing energy levels. Here’s what I need: [adjusted deadlines, breaks].'"
"What if therapy is too expensive?","Many options exist: University training clinics (low-cost), Open Path Collective ($30-60/session), or free support groups (NAMI, DBSA)."
"Is it normal to grieve non-death losses?","Yes! Job loss, divorce, or health changes warrant grief. Write a letter to what you’ve lost. Rituals (lighting a candle) can help closure."
"How do I stop negative self-talk?","Talk to yourself like a friend. When you think 'I’m a failure,' ask: 'Would I say this to someone I love?' Challenge the evidence."
"Can pets improve mental health?","Absolutely! Pets reduce cortisol (stress hormone) and provide companionship. Even watching fish lowers anxiety. Volunteer at shelters if you can’t adopt."
"Help—my friend is suicidal. What do I do?","Stay calm. Ask directly: 'Are you thinking about suicide?' Listen without judgment. Call a crisis line WITH them. Never keep it secret."
