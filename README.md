# Mental Health Support Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered mental health chatbot that provides empathetic support, detects high-risk emotional content, and offers helpful responses or emergency suggestions.

It was built as part of the **June 3MTT Knowledge Showcase**.

## Problem

In Nigeria and many parts of the world, mental health issues like anxiety and depression are often stigmatized or ignored. Many people don’t have access to professional help or a listening ear in moments of distress.

---

## Solution

I built a simple chatbot using **Python, NLTK (Natural Language Processing)**, and a curated FAQ dataset. The chatbot analyzes user messages and does the following:

- Detects **emotional tone** using sentiment analysis (VADER)
- Identifies **risk keywords** like “can’t cope” or “suicide”
- Offers **predefined helpful responses**
- Recommends a **helpline** in critical situations
- Logs all inputs and responses (for SQL/Excel use later)

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK (VADER)
- Flask (for optional web deployment)
- Excel (for data cleaning)
- SQL (for logging responses)
